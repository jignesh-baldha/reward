* Xdebug3 support
* docker-compose v2 support (Docker Desktop will throw an error if you'd like to delete the stack on the GUI. It happens
  because the compose yaml files are temporary files and Docker Desktop can't reach them)
* Install mutagen-beta for macOS (as it seems to be more stable); this should also run mutagen daemon stop and start
* Xdebug support with WSL2
